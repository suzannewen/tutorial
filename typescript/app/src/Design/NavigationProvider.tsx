 * <p/>
 * Defined as 2 x appDrawer for no good reason other than I like the look of it.
 * This is very likely too slow and a result of "creator bias" - I think
 * it looks right because I wrote it and want to watch it happen.
 * <p/>
 * Should probably be appDrawerTimeout or less. Good design, especially as it
 * relates to animations, should be subliminal / barely noticable. My
 * personal desire that everyone should notice the cool screen transitions is
 * the antithesis of good design.
